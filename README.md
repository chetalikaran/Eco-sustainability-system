AI‑Eco‑Score‑Predictor

📝 GitHub Repo Description (Top section)
An AI‑based sustainability project that predicts an Eco Score (0–100) for products using manufacturing and logistics parameters such as plastic usage, energy consumption, water usage, transport distance, recyclability, and packaging level.
The system helps evaluate whether a product is Highly Sustainable, Moderately Sustainable, or Not Sustainable, supporting green decision‑making in industry.

🌱 AI Eco‑Score Predictor for Sustainable Products
📌 Overview
Sustainability has become a key focus for modern industries. This project uses Machine Learning to predict the environmental sustainability of products by analyzing real‑world manufacturing factors.
The model outputs an Eco Score that helps companies and consumers make environmentally responsible choices.

🎯 Objectives
Predict eco‑friendliness of products using AI

Reduce environmental impact through data‑driven decisions

Provide an automated sustainability evaluation system

🧠 Features Used
Plastic used (grams)

Energy used in production (kWh)

Water usage (litres)

Transport distance (km)

Recyclability percentage (%)

Packaging level (1–5)

⚙️ Machine Learning Model
Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor

Reason: Handles non‑linear relationships and provides high accuracy

Performance:

R² Score ≈ 0.86

MAE ≈ 6

📊 Eco Score Classification
≥ 75 → Highly Sustainable

45 – 74 → Moderately Sustainable

< 45 → Not Sustainable
